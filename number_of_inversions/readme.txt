Takes a text file with numbers on separate lines as input and counts the number of inversions in the list. 
Inversion is a case when for a given pair of indices (i,j) in a list A, A[i]>A[j].

Logic
-------------
* Using divide and conquer can give an efficieny of n.log n
* Similar to merge sort in the sense that there is a left and a right split, in case there is a a split element, when adding an element from the RHS list into the merged list, count the number of elements remaining in the LHS list. Sum of these counts is the result.
